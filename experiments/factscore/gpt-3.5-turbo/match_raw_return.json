The input is:\n'Ruth Fischer was a prominent German communist, journalist, and political activist during the early 20th century. She was born in 1895 in Leipzig, Germany, and became involved in socialist and communist politics at a young age. Fischer played a key role in the founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and served as a member of its central committee. She was known for her uncompromising stance on revolutionary tactics and her fierce opposition to fascism. Fischer was forced into exile in the 1930s due to her communist activities and later settled in the Soviet Union. Despite her early support for the Soviet regime, she eventually fell out of favor with Stalin and was expelled from the Communist Party. Fischer continued to write and advocate for socialist causes until her death in 1961.'"
