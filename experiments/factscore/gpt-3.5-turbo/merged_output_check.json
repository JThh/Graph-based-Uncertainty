        "merged_output_closeness_percentile40":"Billy Snedden, born in Perth in 1926, was an Australian politician who made significant contributions to the country's political landscape. Serving as the leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1972 to 1975, Snedden quickly rose through the ranks of the party, known for his moderate views and pragmatic approach to policy. Elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 1955, he held various ministerial positions, including Attorney-General, Minister for Immigration, and Minister for Labour and National Service. Despite being seen as a potential future Prime Minister, Snedden was ultimately replaced as leader in 1975, resigning from the position. Throughout his 22-year tenure as a Member of Parliament, Snedden was respected by colleagues on both sides of the political aisle for his intelligence, wit, and determination. He remained dedicated to his principles and serving the Australian people until his death in 1987, leaving behind a legacy of dedication to public service and political prowess.",
