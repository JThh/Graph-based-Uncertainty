Born in 1895, Fischer became involved in socialist and communist movements at a young age, eventually joining the German Communist Party in 1920. She quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the party's most influential leaders, advocating for a more radical approach to socialism and opposing the rise of fascism in Germany. Fischer's outspoken critiques of the Nazi regime led to her arrest and imprisonment in 1933, and she was eventually forced into exile in the Soviet Union. Despite her initial support for the Communist Party, Fischer later became disillusioned with the Soviet leadership and was eventually expelled from the party. She continued to work as a journalist and writer, speaking out against Stalinism and advocating for democratic socialism until her death in 1961."
