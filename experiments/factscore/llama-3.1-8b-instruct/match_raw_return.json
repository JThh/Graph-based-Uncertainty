The input is:\n'John Atkinson Grimshaw (1836-1893) was an English artist, primarily known for his nocturnal landscapes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life. He was a prominent figure in the Victorian era, and his work often captured the essence of industrialization and urbanization.\n\n**Early Life and Training**\n\nGrimshaw was born on September 6, 1836, in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, to John Grimshaw, a clockmaker, and Elizabeth Atkinson Grimshaw. He was the second of five children. His father, who was a skilled craftsman, encouraged his son's artistic talent from an early age.\n\nIn 1851, Grimshaw began his apprenticeship with a local artist, William Wailes, who specialized in stained-glass design.

He later earned his Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of London in 1983.\n\nYusuf began his career in the Somali judiciary in 1977 and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1997, he was appointed as a Judge of the ICJ, a position he held until his election as President of the Court in 2018.\n\nDuring his tenure as President of the ICJ, Yusuf presided over several high-profile cases, including the maritime border dispute between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), the case concerning the border dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras (Nicaragua v. Honduras), and the case concerning the border dispute between Colombia and Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. Colombia).\n\nOn July 6, 2018, the UN General Assembly elected Yusuf as the President of the ICJ, receiving 93 votes. He took office on September 4, 2018, and served for a three-year term.\n\nUnder Yusuf's leadership, the ICJ continued to play a crucial role in resolving international disputes and promoting the rule of law. His presidency was marked by a focus on increasing the Court's visibility and outreach to the broader international community.\n\nYusuf has also been a strong advocate for the importance of international law in resolving conflicts and promoting peace and security. In a speech delivered on October 4, 2018, he emphasized the need for states to respect and uphold their international obligations, saying: \"The rule of law is not a luxury, it is a necessity for the maintenance of peace and security in the world.\"\n\nYusuf's term as President of the ICJ came to an end on September 3, 2021, when he was succeeded by Joan E. Donoghue of the United States. Despite his departure from the presidency, Yusuf remains a respected figure in the international community and continues to serve as a Judge of the ICJ.'"

However, I found a Japanese poet named Beisen (also known as Beisen Kubota) who was active during the Edo period (1603-1868). \n\nBeisen Kubota (, 1763-1820) was a Japanese poet from the Kubota family, who were samurai from the Akita Domain in northern Japan. He was a member of the Akita Domain's samurai class and was known for his poetry, particularly in the style of the traditional Japanese poetry form called \"waka.\"\n\nBeisen Kubota was born in 1763 in Akita Domain, which is now part of Akita Prefecture in northern Japan. He was a member of the Kubota family, who were known for their literary and artistic talents. Beisen's poetry was influenced by the traditional Japanese poetry forms, such as waka and haiku.\n\nBeisen Kubota's poetry is characterized by its simplicity, elegance, and natural imagery. He often wrote about the beauty of nature, the changing seasons, and the fleeting nature of life. His poetry was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he was known for his skill in capturing the essence of the natural world in his verses.\n\nSome of Beisen Kubota's notable works include his collection of poetry called \"Kubota Beisen sh\u016b\" (, Kubota Beisen's Poetry Collection), which contains over 1,000 poems written in the traditional Japanese poetry forms. His poetry was also included in the \"Shin Kokin Wakash\u016b\" (, New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), a famous anthology of Japanese poetry.\n\nBeisen Kubota died in 1820 at the age of 57. Despite his relatively short life, he left behind a significant body of work that continues to be studied and appreciated by scholars and poetry enthusiasts today.'"

However, I found a Japanese poet named Beisen (also known as Beisen Kubota) who was active during the Edo period (1603-1868). \n\nBeisen Kubota (, 1763-1820) was a Japanese poet from the Kubota family, who were samurai from the Akita Domain in northern Japan. He was a member of the Akita Domain's samurai class and was known for his poetry, particularly in the style of the traditional Japanese poetry form called \"waka.\"\n\nBeisen Kubota was born in 1763 in Akita Domain, which is now part of Akita Prefecture in northern Japan. He was a member of the Kubota family, who were known for their literary and artistic talents. Beisen's poetry was influenced by the traditional Japanese poetry forms, such as waka and haiku.\n\nBeisen Kubota's poetry is characterized by its simplicity, elegance, and natural imagery. He often wrote about the beauty of nature, the changing seasons, and the fleeting nature of life. His poetry was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he was known for his skill in capturing the essence of the natural world in his verses.\n\nSome of Beisen Kubota's notable works include his collection of poetry called \"Kubota Beisen sh\u016b\" (, Kubota Beisen's Poetry Collection), which contains over 1,000 poems written in the traditional Japanese poetry forms. His poetry was also included in the \"Shin Kokin Wakash\u016b\" (, New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), a famous anthology of Japanese poetry.\n\nBeisen Kubota died in 1820 at the age of 57. Despite his relatively short life, he left behind a significant body of work that continues to be studied and appreciated by scholars and poetry enthusiasts today.'"

Ewert was a key figure in the Comintern, the international organization of communist parties, and played a significant role in the development of the German Communist Party (KPD).\n\nEwert was involved in various revolutionary activities, including the Spartacist uprising in 1919, which was an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic in Germany. He also participated in the Hamburg Uprising in 1923, a failed communist insurrection in the city of Hamburg.\n\nIn 1925, Ewert was elected to the Central Committee of the KPD, where he became a close associate of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, the party's leader. Ewert was known for his advocacy of a more radical approach to communism, which often put him at odds with other party leaders.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Ewert traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia, attending various international communist conferences and meetings. He was a delegate to the 6th World Congress of the Comintern in 1928, where he advocated for a more aggressive approach to revolutionary activity.\n\nIn 1933, following the Nazi seizure of power in Germany, Ewert fled to the Soviet Union, where he continued to work with the Comintern. He was a key figure in the development of the International Brigades, a group of foreign volunteers who fought on behalf of the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nEwert was also involved in the development of the German resistance movement against the Nazi regime. He worked closely with other anti-Nazi activists, including the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the German People's Party (DVP).\n\nEwert died on January 21, 1959, in East Berlin, East Germany. His legacy as a communist revolutionary and anti-Nazi activist has been the subject of ongoing debate and discussion among historians and scholars.\n\nSome specific details and examples of Ewert's life and activities include:\n\n* In 1919, Ewert participated in the Spartacist uprising, which was led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.\n* In 1923, Ewert was involved in the Hamburg Uprising, which was led by the KPD and the SPD.'"
