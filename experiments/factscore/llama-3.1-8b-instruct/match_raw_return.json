Romulo was a renowned Filipino diplomat, journalist, and politician who played a pivotal role in shaping the Philippines' foreign policy during the mid-20th century.

He began his education at the Camiling Elementary School and later transferred to the Camiling High School, where he graduated valedictorian in 1914. Romulo then pursued higher education at the University of the Philippines, graduating with a degree in education in 1918. In 1919, he went to the United States, where he earned a master's degree in education from Columbia University and a Ph.D. in history from the University of Pennsylvania in 1929.

The input is:\n'Arthur Ewert was a German communist and a key figure in the Comintern. Born on April 16, 1890, in Potsdam, Germany, Ewert studied economics and joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) early in his life. However, he soon became disillusioned with the SPD's reformist approach and in 1915, he joined the Spartacus League, a Marxist organization that would later become the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). \n\nEwert's involvement with the Spartacus League led him to participate in the German Revolution of 1918-1919. He later became a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, serving as a key liaison between the Comintern and the KPD. Ewert was known for his advocacy of the Comintern's policies, particularly the 'Third Period' of revolutionary upsurge, which emphasized the inevitability of a global capitalist collapse and the need for a united front against fascism. \n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, Ewert worked closely with other prominent communists, including Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, and was involved in various clandestine activities, including espionage and propaganda efforts. However, with the rise of Nazism in Germany, Ewert's activities became increasingly clandestine, and he eventually went into hiding in France. \n\nEwert was captured by the Nazis in 1940 and subsequently imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Despite his imprisonment, Ewert continued to be involved in communist activities, and after the war, he returned to the Soviet Union, where he remained until his death in 1959.'"
