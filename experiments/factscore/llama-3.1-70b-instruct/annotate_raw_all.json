In addition to Zamo\u015b\u0107, he also funded four other towns: Szarogr\u00f3d, Skinderpol, Busza and Jasnogr\u00f3d. Zamoyski collected a significant library, and was a patron of numerous artists in his Fee Tail. Artists under his patronage included the poets Jan Kochanowski and Szymon Szymonowic, and the writer and historian Joachim Bielski.Assessment and legacy.:Personality. Zamoyski was not a deeply religious person, and his conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism was primarily pragmatic. Le\u015bniewski notes that Zamoyski was often motivated by greed, for example during the Danzig Rebellion, when he supported lenient treatment of the rebels, and during the 1577\u20131578 negotiations with, when he favored the solution of George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach; in both cases his decision was likely influenced by bribes or favors. In another example, Le\u015bniewski describes how Zamoyski openly demanded rewards following his victory at Byczyna, and tried to include an article favoring him in the Bytom and B\u0119dzin\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText: jm of 1585.Biography.:Later years. After the death of Batory in 1586, Zamoyski helped Sigismund III Vasa gain the Polish throne, fighting in the brief civil war against the forces supporting Habsburg archduke Maximilian III of Austria. The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian was supported by the Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Krak\u00f3w and defeated Maximilian's forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which S\u0142awomir Le\u015bniewski describes as \"one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski's military career\", Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and B\u0119dzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown. Later that year Zamoyski proposed a reform of the royal elections, which failed to pass the Sejm. Zamoyski presented to this Sejm a project that in case the present King should die without issue none but a candidate of some Slav stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne. This was a project which\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText:  civil war plaguing Muscovy (the Time of Troubles and the Dymitriads).

He was praised by artists such as Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanis\u0142aw Staszic, Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski and Artur \u015aliwi\u0144ski. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj, J\u00f3zef Szujski, Micha\u0142 Bobrzy\u0144ski. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski's posthumous career was even more magnificent than his real one.

In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski took part in the war against Sweden commanding the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command.

Subsequently, he was part of the diplomatic mission that traveled to France to finish formalities with the newly elected king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henryk secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti-Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which ended up in the marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti-Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania. Bathory thanked Zamoyski by granting him the office of Deputy Chancellor on 16 May 1576.

He defeated him on the Bukova (Bucovu) and restored Ieremia to the throne. He also helped his brother, Simion Movil\u0103 to become brief ruler of Wallachia, thus spreading the influence of the Commonwealth to the Central Danube. In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski took part in the war against Sweden commanding the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command. At the Sejm of 1603 Zamoyski led opposition to the governance reforms proposed by Sigismund; seeing in them intentions of transforming the Commonwealth into an absolute monarchy. Later, he also opposed Sigismund's plans to intervene in the\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText:  throne. The new King feared the chancellor's power, but due to Commonwealth laws he was unable to dismiss him from his posts. He offered him a prestigious voivode of Krak\u00f3w office, but Zamoyski declined, as if he was to accept, the law would require him to resign from his slightly less prestigious but more influential chancellorship. By 1590\u20131591 Zamoyski was seen as one of the king's staunchest opponents. Open quarrel between king and chancellor broke out during the Sejm of 1591, culminating in a heated exchange of words and the king storming out of the chamber. Despite their tensed relations, neither the king nor the chancellor wanted a civil war; soon after their quarrel Zamoyski would issue a public apology to the king and their uneasy relationship would continue until Zamoyski's death. In 1594 Zamoyski once again failed to stop a Tatar incursion in the southern borders. The next year was much more successful, as in Moldavia in 1595 he was victorious in the Battle of Cecora, and helped hospodar Ieremia Movil\u0103 (Jeremi Mohy\u0142a) gain the throne.

As early as the late 1880s, Eminescu had a group of faithful followers. His 1883 poem \"Luceaf\u0103rul\" was so notable that a new literary review took its name after it. The most realistic psychological analysis of Eminescu was written by I. L. Caragiale, who, after the poet's death published three short articles on this subject: \"In Nirvana\", \"Irony\" and \"Two notes\". Caragiale stated that Eminescu's characteristic feature was the fact that \"he had an excessively unique nature\". Eminescu's life was a continuous oscillation between introvert and extrovert attitudes. The portrait that Titu Maiorescu made in the study \"Eminescu and poems\" emphasizes Eminescu's introvert dominant traits.

Mihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in Boto\u0219ani, Moldavia. He spent his early childhood in Boto\u0219ani and Ipote\u0219ti, in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866 he attended school in Cern\u0103u\u021bi. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of \"gymnasium\". The first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year Romanian teacher Aron Pumnul died and his students in Cern\u0103u\u0163i published a pamphlet, \"L\u0103cr\u0103mioarele \u00eenv\u0103\u021b\u0103ceilor gimnazia\u0219ti\" (\"The Tears of the Gymnasium Students\")\n\nTitle: Mihai Eminescu\nText: or mei\"), and this designation, his untimely death as well as his bohemian lifestyle (he never pursued a degree, a position, a wife or fortune) had him associated with the Romantic figure of the genius. As early as the late 1880s, Eminescu had a group of faithful followers. His 1883 poem \"Luceaf\u0103rul\" was so notable that a new literary review took its name after it. The most realistic psychological analysis of Eminescu was written by I. L. Caragiale, who, after the poet's death published three short articles on this subject: \"In Nirvana\", \"Irony\" and \"Two notes\". Caragiale stated that Eminescu's characteristic feature was the fact that \"he had an excessively unique nature\". Eminescu's life was a continuous oscillation between introvert and extrovert attitudes. The portrait that Titu Maiorescu made in the study \"Eminescu and poems\" emphasizes Eminescu's introvert dominant traits. Titu Maiorescu promoted the image of a dreamer who was far away from reality, who did not suffer because of the material conditions that he lived in, regardless of all the ironies and eul\n\nTitle: Mihai Eminescu\nText:  Europe in the 19th century, because of its adverse effects. Mihai Eminescu died at 4\u00a0am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a sanatorium run by Dr. Su\u021bu and located on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu's last wish was a glass of milk, which the attending doctor slipped through the metallic peephole of the \"cell\" where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he was said to have whispered, \"I'm crumbled\". The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Su\u021bu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as ambiguous, because the poet's cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet's medical file and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not physical disorder. Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babe\u0219-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently forgot\n\nTitle: Mihai Eminescu\nText:  hypotheses on the cause of death of the poet. According to them, the poet died of cardio-respiratory arrest caused by mercury poisoning. Eminescu was wrongly diagnosed and treated, aiming his removal from public life, as some eminescologists claim. Eminescu was diagnosed since 1886 by Dr. Julian Bogdan from Ia\u0219i as syphilitic, paralytic and on the verge of dementia due to alcohol abuse and syphilitic gummas emerged on the brain. The same diagnosis is given by Dr. Panait Zosin, who consulted Eminescu on 6 November 1886 and wrote that patient Eminescu suffered from a \"mental alienation\", caused by the emergence of syphilis and worsened by alcoholism. Further research showed that the poet was not suffering from syphilis.Works. Nicolae Iorga, the Romanian historian, considers Eminescu the godfather of the modern Romanian language, in the same way that Shakespeare is seen to have directly influenced the English language.

Eminescu was an active member of the Junimea literary society and worked as an editor for the newspaper \"Timpul\" (\"The Time\"), the official newspaper of the Conservative Party (1880\u20131918). His poetry was first published when he was 16 and he went to Vienna, Austria to study when he was 19. The poet's manuscripts, containing 46 volumes and approximately 14,000 pages, were offered by Titu Maiorescu as a gift to the Romanian Academy during the meeting that was held on 25 January 1902. Notable works include \"Luceaf\u0103rul\" (\"The Vesper/The Evening Star/The Lucifer/The Daystar\"), \"Od\u0103 \u00een metru antic\" (\"Ode in Ancient Meter\"), and the five \"Letters\" (\"Epistles/Satires\"). In his poems, he frequently used metaphysical, mythological and historical subjects. His father was Gheorghe Eminovici, an arist.\n\nInput: Mihai Eminescu remains one of Romania's most beloved and revered writers..\nIs the input Subjective or Objective? If objective, True or False?

Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process.

True to the Pre-Raphaelite style, he created landscapes of accurate colour and lighting, vivid detail and realism, often typifying seasons or a type of weather. Moonlit views of city and suburban streets and of the docks in London, Hull, Liverpool, and Glasgow also figured largely in his art. His careful painting and his skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His \"paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene.\" \"Dulce Domum\" (1885), on whose reverse Grimshaw wrote, \"mostly painted under great difficulties\", captures the music portrayed in the piano-player, entices the eye to meander through the richly decorated room, and to consider the\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: , recording \"the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry.\" Grimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. \"Shipping on the Clyde\", a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.Reputation and legacy.

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999). Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, which Caravaggio and Vermeer may also have used, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\".

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999). Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, which Caravaggio and Vermeer may also have used, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\".

True to the Pre-Raphaelite style, he created landscapes of accurate colour and lighting, vivid detail and realism, often typifying seasons or a type of weather. Moonlit views of city and suburban streets and of the docks in London, Hull, Liverpool, and Glasgow also figured largely in his art. His careful painting and his skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His \"paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene.\" \"Dulce Domum\" (1885), on whose reverse Grimshaw wrote, \"mostly painted under great difficulties\", captures the music portrayed in the piano-player, entices the eye to meander through the richly decorated room, and to consider the\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: cturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J. A. Grimshaw\", or \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", though he finally settled on \"Atkinson Grimshaw\".Life. He was born on 6 September 1836 in a back-to-back house in Park Street, Leeds to Mary and David Grimshaw. In 1856 he married his cousin Frances Hubbard (1835\u20131917). In 1861, at the age of 24, to the dismay of his parents, he left his job as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway to become a painter. He first exhibited in 1862, mostly paintings of birds, fruit, and blossom, under the patronage of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. He and his wife moved in 1866 to a semi-detached villa, which is now numbered 56 Cliff Road in Headingley and has a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque, and in 1870 to Knostrop Old Hall. Grid Reference: SE 32125 32100. He became successful in the 1870s and rented a second home, Castle-by-the-Sea in Scarborough. Scarborough became a favourite subject. He died on 13 October 1893 of tuberculosis and is buried in Wood\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: , recording \"the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry.\" Grimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. \"Shipping on the Clyde\", a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.Reputation and legacy. Grimshaw left behind no letters, journals, or papers. His reputation rested on, and his legacy is based on, his townscapes. There was a revival of interest in Grimshaw's work in the second half of the 20th century, with several important exhibitions devoted to it. A retrospective exhibition \"Atkinson Grimshaw \u2013 Painter of Moonlight\" ran from 16 April \u2013 4 September 2011 at Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate and subsequently in the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.Further reading. - Alexander Robertson, \"Atkinson Grimshaw\", London, Phaidon Press, 1996 - Yorkshire Art Journal \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", York, 2014 - Historical Feature\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: John Atkinson Grimshaw John Atkinson Grimshaw (6 September 1836 \u2013 13 October 1893) was an English Victorian-era artist best known for his nocturnal scenes of urban landscapes. He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999). Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, which Caravaggio and Vermeer may also have used, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\". However, many recognised his mastery of colour, lighting and shadow, as well as his unique ability to provoke strong emotional responses in the viewer. James McNeill Whistler, who Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, \"I considered myself the inventor of no.\n\nInput: John Atkinson Grimshaw left behind a legacy as one of the most beloved artists of the Victorian era..\nIs the input Subjective or Objective?

Wolf Helman later changed his name to Tadeusz Wieniawski, taking on the name of his neighborhood to blend into the Polish environment. Prior to obtaining his medical degree, he had converted to Catholicism. He married Regina Wolff, the daughter of a noted Jewish physician from Warsaw, and out of this marriage, Henryk was born.

After graduation, he toured extensively and gave many recitals, where he was often accompanied by his brother J\u00f3zef on piano. In 1847, he published his first opus, a \"Grand Caprice Fantastique\", the start of a catalogue of 24 opus numbers. When his engagement to Isabella Hampton was opposed by her parents, Wieniawski wrote \"L\u00e9gende\", Op.\u00a017; this work helped her parents change their mind, and the couple married in 1860. At the invitation of Anton Rubinstein, Wieniawski moved to St. Petersburg, where he lived from 1860 to 1872, taught many violin students and led the Russian Musical Society's orchestra and string quartet. From 1872 to 1874, Wieniawski toured the United States with Rubinstein. Wieniawski replaced Henri Vieuxtemps as violin professor at the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles in 1875.

Himmler formed the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and built extermination camps. As overseer of the Nazi genocidal programs, Himmler directed the killing of some six million Jews, between 200,000 and 500,000 Romanis, and other victims. The total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at 11 to 14 million people. Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens. Late in World War II, Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\"Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung\"). Specifically, he was given command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula. After Himmler failed to achieve his assigned objectives, Hitler replaced him in these posts.

His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (1865\u20131936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 1866\u20131941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (1898\u20131982) and Ernst Hermann (1905\u20131945). Himmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics.

Bormann used his position as Hitler's secretary to control the flow of information and access to Hitler. Hitler promoted and practised the \"F\u00fchrerprinzip\". The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he\u2014like other top Nazi officials\u2014had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.

Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. Historian Wolfgang Sauer says that \"although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler.\" In 2008, the German news magazine described Himmler as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history and the architect of the Holocaust.

Himmler maintained a polite demeanor with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism. During his second year at university, Himmler redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met Ernst R\u00f6hm, an early member of the Nazi Party and co-founder of the (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA). Himmler admired R\u00f6hm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion Himmler joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the (Imperial War Flag Society). In 1922, Himmler became more interested in the \"Jewish question\", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates.

The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the Nazi Party, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit.

After the murder of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau on 24 June, Himmler's political views veered towards the radical right, and he took part in demonstrations against the Treaty of Versailles. Hyperinflation was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons. Disappointed by his failure to make a career in the military and his parents' inability to finance his doctoral studies, he was forced to take a low-paying office job after obtaining his agricultural diploma. He remained in this position until September 1923.Early life.:Nazi activist. Himmler joined the Nazi Party in August 1923, receiving party number 14303. As a member of R\u00f6hm's paramilitary unit, Himmler was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch\u2014an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the Nazi Party to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence.

Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main architect of the Holocaust. As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service, and did not fight. He studied agriculture at university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed by Adolf Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police).

Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members. In 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the Nazi Party appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the Nazi Party, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the Nazi.\n\nInput: Heinrich Himmler joined the Nazi Party in 1923..\nIs the input Subjective or Objective?

Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD. Hitler decided on 21 June that R\u00f6hm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. He sent G\u00f6ring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where R\u00f6hm was arrested; he gave R\u00f6hm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When R\u00f6hm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives.

The performance of the eastern Waffen-SS units was, as a whole, sub-standard. In late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname \"the Butcher of Prague\". This appointment strengthened the collaboration between Himmler and Heydrich, and Himmler was proud to have SS control over a state.

Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of (\"mission command\"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.See also. - Glossary of Nazi Germany - Heinrich Himmler papers - \"Lebensborn\" - List of Nazi Party leaders and officials - List of SS personnelReferences.References.:Bibliography.

The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. They further wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As a student of agriculture and a farmer, Himmler was acquainted with the principles of selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades of the end of the war.Final Solution, the Holocaust, racial policy, and eugenics.:Posen speeches.

Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by firing squad, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. In August 1941, Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk. Nauseated and shaken by the experience, he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found. On his orders, by early 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B. Himmler visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker\u00a02 and toured the building site of the new IG Farben plant being constructed at the nearby town of Monowitz. By the end of the war, at least 5.5\u00a0million Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime; most estimates range closer to 6\u00a0million.

In a prisoner revolt that October, the remaining prisoners killed most of the guards and SS personnel. Several hundred prisoners escaped; about a hundred were immediately re-captured and killed. Some of the escapees joined partisan units operating in the area. The camp was dismantled by December 1943. The Nazis also targeted Romani (Gypsies) as \"asocial\" and \"criminals\". By 1935, they were confined into special camps away from ethnic Germans. In 1938, Himmler issued an order in which he said that the \"Gypsy question\" would be determined by \"race\". Himmler believed that the Romani were originally Aryan but had become a mixed race; only the \"racially pure\" were to be allowed to live. In 1939, Himmler ordered thousands of Gypsies to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp and by 1942, ordered all Romani sent to Auschwitz concentration camp.

Himmler placed particular importance on the death's-head rings; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the death's-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death.Relationship with Hitler. As second in command of the SS and then Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler. Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders,\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position as Hitler's secretary to control the flow of information and access to Hitler. Hitler promoted and practised the \"F\u00fchrerprinzip\". The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he\u2014like other top Nazi officials\u2014had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler. Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.

By this time, the Soviets had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, only from the Reich Chancellery, and were preparing to storm the Chancellery.

The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house.

Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members. In 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the Nazi Party appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the Nazi Party, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature.

As second in command of the SS and then Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler. Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.

His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (1865\u20131936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 1866\u20131941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (1898\u20131982) and Ernst Hermann (1905\u20131945). Himmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger.

Himmler met his future wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts\u2014mostly unsuccessful\u2014to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, T\u00f6hle.\n\nInput: Heinrich Himmler earned the nickname 'Der treue Heinrich' (Faithful Heinrich)..\nIs the input Subjective or Objective? If objective, True or False?

He again placed Heydrich in command. Under Himmler's leadership, the SS developed its own military branch, the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (SS-VT), which later evolved into the Waffen-SS. Nominally under the authority of Himmler, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarised structure of command and operations. It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the \"Heer\" (army), but never being formally part of it. In addition to his military ambitions, Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS. To this end, administrator Oswald Pohl set up the \"Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe\" (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses. Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  from the Netherlands to 300 each from Sweden and Switzerland.

The performance of the eastern Waffen-SS units was, as a whole, sub-standard. In late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname \"the Butcher of Prague\". This appointment strengthened the collaboration between Himmler and Heydrich, and Himmler was proud to have SS control over a state. Despite having direct access to Hitler, Heydrich's loyalty to Himmler remained firm. With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the \"Einsatzgruppen\" in the lead-up to the planned invasion of the Soviet Union.

The total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at 11 to 14 million people. Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens.

Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich, and named Himmler Chief of German Police and a State Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. In this role, Himmler was still nominally subordinate to Frick. In practice, however, the police was now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force. He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Orpo: \"order police\"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege. Shortly thereafter, Himmler created the \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Kripo: criminal police) as the umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany. The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command.

Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main architect of the Holocaust. As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service, and did not fight. He studied agriculture at university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed by Adolf Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). He controlled the Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS. Himmler held an interest in varieties of occultism and \"V\u00f6lkisch\" topics,\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  armaments until January 1945.Command of army group. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France during Operation Overlord. In response, Army Group Upper Rhine (\"Heeresgruppe Oberrhein\") group was formed to engage the advancing US 7th Army (under command of General Alexander Patch) and French 1st Army (led by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny) in the Alsace region along the west bank of the Rhine. In late 1944, Hitler appointed Himmler commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine. On 26 September 1944 Hitler ordered Himmler to create special army units, the \"Volkssturm\" (\"People's Storm\" or \"People's Army\"). All males aged sixteen to sixty were eligible for conscription into this militia, over the protests of Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who noted that irreplaceable skilled workers were being removed from armaments production. Hitler confidently believed six million men could be raised, and the new units would \"initiate a people's war against the invader\". These hopes were wildly optimistic. In October 1944, children as young as fourteen were being enlisted. Because of severe shortages in weapons and equipment\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText: rouping\". Hitler officially ended Operation Solstice on 21 February and ordered Himmler to transfer a corps headquarter and three divisions to Army Group Center. Himmler was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives. Under pressure from Hitler over the worsening military situation, Himmler became anxious and unable to give him coherent reports. When the counter-attack failed to stop the Soviet advance, Hitler held Himmler personally liable and accused him of not following orders. Himmler's military command ended on 20 March, when Hitler replaced him with General Gotthard Heinrici as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula. By this time Himmler, who had been under the care of his doctor since 18 February, had fled to the Hohenlychen Sanatorium. Hitler sent Guderian on a forced medical leave of absence, and he reassigned his post as chief of staff to Hans Krebs on 29 March. Himmler's failure and Hitler's response marked a serious deterioration in the relationship between the two men. By that time, the inner circle of people whom Hitler trusted was rapidly shrinking.Command of army group.:Peace negotiations. In early 1945, the German war effort was on the verge of\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  Since the Replacement Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans J\u00fcttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Replacement Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS. By this time, Hitler had appointed Himmler as \"Reichsminister\" of the Interior, succeeding Frick, and General Plenipotentiary for Administration (\"Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung\"). At the same time (24 August 1943) he also joined the six-member Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich, which operated as the war cabinet. In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Replacement Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also in charge of the Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  and he employed elements of these beliefs to develop the racial policy of Nazi Germany and incorporated esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS. Himmler formed the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and built extermination camps. As overseer of the Nazi genocidal programs, Himmler directed the killing of some six million Jews, between 200,000 and 500,000 Romanis, and other victims. The total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at 11 to 14 million people. Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens. Late in World War II, Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\"Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung\"). Specifically, he was given command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula. After Himmler failed to achieve his assigned objectives, Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising the war was lost, Himmler attempted to open peace talks with the western Allies without Hitler's knowledge, shortly before the end of the war. Hearing of this, Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest.

Rejected by his former comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he carried a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hizinger. With a small band of companions, he headed south on 11 May to Friedrichskoog, without a final destination in mind. They continued on to Neuhaus, where the group split up. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint in Bremerv\u00f6rde set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near L\u00fcneburg, on 23 May.

While in British custody, he committed suicide on 23 May 1945.Early life. Heinrich Luitpold Himmler was born in Munich on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Roman Catholic family. His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (1865\u20131936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 1866\u20131941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (1898\u20131982) and Ernst Hermann (1905\u20131945). Himmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  killed at 11\u00a0million and told the attendees that Hitler had placed Himmler in charge of the plan. In June 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in Prague in Operation Anthropoid, led by Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk and Jan Kubi\u0161, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile. Both men had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive for the mission to kill Heydrich. During the two funeral services, Himmler\u2014the chief mourner\u2014took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults in the village of Le\u017e\u00e1ky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the camps\u2014three extermination camps\u2014to be constructed at Be\u0142\u017c\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler had long considered Himmler to be second only to Joseph Goebbels in loyalty; he called Himmler \"the loyal Heinrich\" (). Hitler flew into a rage at this betrayal, and told those still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's secret negotiations were the worst treachery he had ever known. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest, and Fegelein was court-martialed and shot. By this time, the Soviets had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, only from the Reich Chancellery, and were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to write his last will and testament. In the testament, completed on 29 April\u2014one day prior to his suicide\u2014Hitler declared both Himmler and G\u00f6ring to be traitors. He stripped Himmler of all of his party and state offices and expelled him from the Nazi Party. Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz as his successor. Himmler met D\u00f6nitz in Flensburg and offered himself as second-in-command. He maintained that he was entitled to\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  identity papers bore a stamp which British military intelligence had seen being used by fleeing members of the SS. The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began a routine interrogation. Himmler admitted who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler was taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army in L\u00fcneburg, where a doctor conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden potassium cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes, despite efforts to expel the poison from his system. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near L\u00fcneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.Mysticism and symbolism. Himmler was interested in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation.

The use of Ewert \u2014 a personal friend and former ideological ally of the expelled dissident Lovestone \u2014 for this task was doubtlessly a form of loyalty-testing and assessment of whether Ewert retained political usefulness to the Comintern.

Ewert's familiarity with the English language and with the affairs of the America Communist Party made him a useful agent to the US, to which he traveled a false passport on Comintern business in 1930. Of primary concern to the Comintern was obtaining an independent assessment of the solidity of the hold over the party apparatus by the faction headed by Earl Browder and William Z. Foster, which had recently assumed control from deposed party leader Jay Lovestone. The use of Ewert \u2014 a personal friend and former ideological ally of the expelled dissident Lovestone \u2014 for this task was doubtlessly a form of loyalty-testing and assessment of whether Ewert retained political usefulness to the Comintern. Ewert seems to have passed the test, avoiding contacts with the Lovestone political organization and gaining the confidence and respect of the new American party leadership.
