The input is:\n'Joseph Jaquet was a highly esteemed Swiss watchmaker who co-founded one of the most respected watch companies in the world, Jaquet-Droz. He was born in 1721 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. His passion for watchmaking was apparent from an early age, and he quickly mastered the intricacies of the craft, leading him to start his own company in 1738 along with his son-in-law, Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leschot. The company was renamed \"Jaquet-Droz & Leschot\" when his son Pierre joined the business. Collectively, they produced some of the finest timepieces of the 18th century, using innovative technologies and designs, including singing birds, fountains, and music boxes. Jaquet passed away in 1784, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence the world of horology.'"

He held the title of Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976, and then served as President from 1976 to 2008. Castro implemented policies of nationalisation and socialist reforms throughout his rule. Internationally, he aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and was a figurehead in the Non-Aligned Movement. His stark resistance to Western imperialism made him a controversial figure and he faced multiple assassination attempts. Despite this, he was praised for his commitment to socialism, anti-imperialism, and humanitarianism.

A 0 is for claims that are very obscure or difficult for anyone to know, like the birthdays of non-notable people. The input is:\n'Arthur Ernst Ewert was a German communist revolutionary, author and government official. He was born on September 13, 1890 in Witzendorf, Germany. Ewert started his political journey as a union representative before later joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and eventually the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which emerged from the radical socialist elements of the SPD in response to the events of World War I. Ewert rose through the ranks to become a prominent member of the KPD, leading strikes and revolts against the Weimar Republic. After years of political activism in Germany, he was marked as a target by the Nazis and was forced to flee to Brazil. In Brazil, he fought covertly against the fascist regimes around the globe during World War II. Ewert was arrested by the Brazilian government in 1937 and spent 15 years in prison enduring torture. He passed away on August 13, 1959 as a result of the harm inflicted against him during his imprisonment.'"

Churchill served as Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945, and again from 1951 to 1955. During his time in office, he was highly influential in implementing social reforms in Britain, but it was his indomitable spirit and leadership during wartime that solidified his place in history. Apart from his political career, he was an accomplished author, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. Churchill passed away on January 24, 1965, leaving behind a legacy of resilience and determination.'"

Born on November 20, 1936, in the Bronx, New York, DeLillo began his writing career in 1960 and has since published numerous novels, plays, and essays. His best-known works include \"White Noise,\" which won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1985, and \"Underworld,\" a National Book Award finalist in 1997, both tackling the socio-cultural complexities of the post-Cold War era. DeLillo's body of work reveals a deep attention to language and a consistently prophetic exploration of technology, media, art, and terrorism, shaping him as one of the most influential American writers of his time.'"

She joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in the early 1920s and subsequently became the first woman to lead a German parliamentary party when she took its helm in 1925. However, her tenure was fraught with discord and factional fighting, ultimately leading to her expulsion from the party in 1926. Despite this, Fischer remained a committed anti-fascist and was driven into exile when the Nazis rose to power. She later emigrated to the United States where she continued her activism and academic work until her death in 1961.'"
