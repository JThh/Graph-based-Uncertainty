He rose through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant in 1961, a year before Uganda gained its independence from Britain. Amin seized power in a military coup in 1971, ousting President Obote. His rule was characterized by gross human rights abuses, political repression, and corruption. He was known for his unpredictable behavior and his love for pomp and ceremony. Amin was forced into exile in 1979, first in Libya, then Iraq, and finally in Saudi Arabia, where he died in 2003."

Born in 1888 in Venezuela, Suarez moved to Italy in his early twenties where he developed a passion for garden design. He was a close friend of art historian Bernard Berenson, who commissioned him to design the gardens of Villa I Tatti. The garden, which is considered one of the finest examples of the Italian Renaissance style, is a testament to Suarez's skill and creativity. His design incorporated a series of terraces, fountains, and an exquisite pebble mosaic, all set against the backdrop of the Tuscan countryside. Suarez passed away in 1974, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful garden designs."

He was a Marxist-Leninist who transformed Cuba into a socialist state under the Communist Party rule, first as a one-party socialist state from 1965 to 2011, and then a socialist republic from 2011 until his retirement in 2008. Castro led the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista, an action that attracted widespread international attention. Castro implemented extensive social and economic reforms and nationalized industry, leading to improved education and healthcare, but also intense political repression and a struggling economy. Despite a heavily embargoed economy, Castro's Cuba made significant advancements in fields such as healthcare and education. Castro, a highly polarizing world figure, died on 25th November 2016."

There, he climbed the ranks and eventually seized power after a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1971. During his time in power, Amin's regime was characterized by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, and immense corruption. He was also infamous for his use of torture, extrajudicial killings, and the expulsion of Indian minority communities. Amin's rule ended in 1979 when he was overthrown by Ugandan nationalists supported by the Tanzanian forces. After living in Libya and Saudi Arabia, he died in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 16 August 2003."

His reign was characterized by gross human rights abuses, political suppression, and corruption. He was known as the \"Butcher of Uganda,\" and it is estimated that approximately 300,000 individuals were killed under his dictatorship.

An intellectual, Fischer was closely associated with the artistic and political circles in Berlin. She joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in the early 1920s and subsequently became the first woman to lead a German parliamentary party when she took its helm in 1925. However, her tenure was fraught with discord and factional fighting, ultimately leading to her expulsion from the party in 1926. Despite this, Fischer remained a committed anti-fascist and was driven into exile when the Nazis rose to power. She later emigrated to the United States where she continued her activism and academic work until her death in 1961."
