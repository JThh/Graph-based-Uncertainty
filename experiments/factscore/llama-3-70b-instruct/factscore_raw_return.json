In 1924, Fischer was elected to the Reichstag, where she became known for her fiery oratory skills and her advocacy for workers' rights and women's equality. However, her criticism of Stalin's policies led to her expulsion from the KPD in 1926, after which she formed her own communist organization, the Communist Party Opposition (KPO).

Born on October 7, 1900, in Munich, Germany, Himmler was the son of a Catholic schoolmaster and was raised in a middle-class family. He served briefly in the German Army during World War I and later studied agriculture, but he became increasingly involved in radical right-wing politics in the 1920s. He joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the leader of the SS (Schutzstaffel) in 1929. As the head of the SS, Himmler oversaw the creation of the Gestapo, the SD (Sicherheitsdienst), and the concentration camp system, and he played a key role in the implementation of the Holocaust. He was also instrumental in the suppression of opposition to the Nazi regime and was known for his ruthless efficiency and ideological fanaticism. Himmler committed suicide on May 23, 1945, while in Allied custody, shortly after Germany's surrender in World War II."
