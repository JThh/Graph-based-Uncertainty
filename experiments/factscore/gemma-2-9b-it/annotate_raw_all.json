He started his education in a school in Krasnystaw but when he was thirteen years old he was sent to study abroad; from 1555 to 1559 he was a page at the royal court in Paris. Already at this young age he attended lectures at the Sorbonne University and Coll\u00e8ge de France. In 1559 he briefly visited Poland, then attended the University of Strasbourg; after a few months there he moved to University of Padua, where from 1561 he studied law and received a doctorate in 1564. During his years abroad he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism. During his education, he became active in university politics, and in 1563 he was elected the rector of the law department. Around that time he also wrote \"De senatu Romano\", a brochure about Ancient Rome government. He returned to the Commonwealth in 1565, and was the first person to receive a commendation letter from the senate of the Republic of Venice.Biography.:Early career. After returning to Poland, he was appointed to the Royal Chancellery, and soon became a favorite secretary to King Sigismund II.

The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian was supported by the Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Krak\u00f3w and defeated Maximilian's forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which S\u0142awomir Le\u015bniewski describes as \"one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski's military career\", Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and B\u0119dzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown.

He also helped his brother, Simion Movil\u0103 to become brief ruler of Wallachia, thus spreading the influence of the Commonwealth to the Central Danube. In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski took part in the war against Sweden commanding the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command. At the Sejm of 1603 Zamoyski led opposition to the governance reforms proposed by Sigismund; seeing in them intentions of transforming the Commonwealth into an absolute monarchy. Later, he also opposed Sigismund's plans to intervene in the\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText:  civil war plaguing Muscovy (the Time of Troubles and the Dymitriads).

At the Sejm of 1603 Zamoyski led opposition to the governance reforms proposed by Sigismund; seeing in them intentions of transforming the Commonwealth into an absolute monarchy. Later, he also opposed Sigismund's plans to intervene in the\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText: jm of 1585.Biography.:Later years. After the death of Batory in 1586, Zamoyski helped Sigismund III Vasa gain the Polish throne, fighting in the brief civil war against the forces supporting Habsburg archduke Maximilian III of Austria. The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian was supported by the Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Krak\u00f3w and defeated Maximilian's forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which S\u0142awomir Le\u015bniewski describes as \"one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski's military career\", Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and B\u0119dzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown. Later that year Zamoyski proposed a reform of the royal elections, which failed to pass the Sejm. Zamoyski presented to this Sejm a project that in case the present King should die without issue none but a candidate of some Slav stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne. This was a project which\n\nTitle: Jan Zamoyski\nText:  could even imagine the possibility of some kind of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy and semi-Protestant Bohemia. In fact, it was a circuitous and clumsy counter-proposal against pro-Habsburg policy. From 1589 Zamoyski, in his role as the hetman, tried to prevent the intensifying Tatar incursions along the Commonwealth south-eastern border, but with little success. In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a buffer zone between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire; this would lead to a lengthy campaign.Biography.:In opposition to the throne. Meanwhile, in internal Commonwealth politics, early on in Sigismund III's reign, Zamoyski, who was once a staunch supporter of the Commonwealth kings, begun to distance himself from the King. Sigismund had quickly allied himself with the Habsburgs, much to chancellors dissatisfaction. Zamoyski was dissatisfied with Sigismund's early plans to use Poland as a stepping stone to gaining the Swedish crown, as Sigismund was plotting to cede the Polish crown to the Habsburgs in exchange for their support of his right to the Swedish.\n\nInput: The victory at the Battle of Khotyn secured the Commonwealth's eastern borders.\nIs the input True or False?

He stated that earlier in the evening, Cheyenne told him that Drollet was physically abusing her. Later that night, Christian confronted Drollet about the abuse. Christian claimed that the gun went off after Drollet tried to take the gun away from him. Christian Brando was immediately arrested and charged with first-degree murder two days later. The prosecutors of the case attempted to subpoena Cheyenne to testify at Christian's trial as they felt her account of the night's event was crucial in proving the shooting was premeditated. However, she refused to testify and fled to Tahiti. On 26 June 1990, she gave birth to a son she named Tuki Brando. Soon after Tuki's birth, Cheyenne attempted suicide twice and was hospitalized for drug detoxification in a psychiatric hospital.

The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, such as his relation with Veronica, his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the \"Junimea\" society or the articles he published in the newspaper \"Timpul\". He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.Romanian culture.:National poet. Eminescu was soon proclaimed Romania's national poet, not because he wrote in an age of national revival, but rather because he was received as an author of paramount significance by Romanians in all provinces.

Grimshaw painted more interior scenes, especially in the 1870s, when he worked under the influence of James Tissot and the Aesthetic Movement. \"On Hampstead Hill\" is considered one of Grimshaw's finest works, exemplifying his skill with a variety of light sources, in capturing the mood of the passing of twilight into night. In his later career his urban scenes under twilight or yellow streetlighting were popular with his middle-class patrons. His later work included imagined scenes from the Greek and Roman empires, and he painted literary subjects from Longfellow and Tennyson \u2014 pictures including \"Elaine\" and \"The Lady of Shalott\". Grimshaw named his children after characters in Tennyson's poems. In the 1880s, Grimshaw maintained a London studio in Chelsea, not far from the studio of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. After visiting Grimshaw, Whistler remarked that \"I considered myself the inventor of Nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" Unlike Whistler's Impressionistic night scenes, Grimshaw worked in a realistic vein: \"sharply focused, almost photographic\", his pictures innovated in applying the tradition of rural moonlight images to the Victorian city\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: house Cemetery, now called St George's Fields, in Leeds.

Grimshaw's primary influence was the Pre-Raphaelites. True to the Pre-Raphaelite style, he created landscapes of accurate colour and lighting, vivid detail and realism, often typifying seasons or a type of weather. Moonlit views of city and suburban streets and of the docks in London, Hull, Liverpool, and Glasgow also figured largely in his art. His careful painting and his skill in lighting effects meant that he captured both the appearance and the mood of a scene in minute detail. His \"paintings of dampened gas-lit streets and misty waterfronts conveyed an eerie warmth as well as alienation in the urban scene.\" \"Dulce Domum\" (1885), on whose reverse Grimshaw wrote, \"mostly painted under great difficulties\", captures the music portrayed in the piano-player, entices the eye to meander through the richly decorated room, and to consider the\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: , recording \"the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry.\" Grimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. \"Shipping on the Clyde\", a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.Reputation and legacy. Grimshaw left behind no letters, journals, or papers. His reputation rested on, and his legacy is based on, his townscapes. There was a revival of interest in Grimshaw's work in the second half of the 20th century, with several important exhibitions devoted to it. A retrospective exhibition \"Atkinson Grimshaw \u2013 Painter of Moonlight\" ran from 16 April \u2013 4 September 2011 at Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate and subsequently in the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.Further reading. - Alexander Robertson, \"Atkinson Grimshaw\", London, Phaidon Press, 1996 - Yorkshire Art Journal \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", York, 2014 - Historical Feature\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: cturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J.

He was born on 6 September 1836 in a back-to-back house in Park Street, Leeds to Mary and David Grimshaw. In 1856 he married his cousin Frances Hubbard (1835\u20131917). In 1861, at the age of 24, to the dismay of his parents, he left his job as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway to become a painter. He first exhibited in 1862, mostly paintings of birds, fruit, and blossom, under the patronage of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. He and his wife moved in 1866 to a semi-detached villa, which is now numbered 56 Cliff Road in Headingley and has a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque, and in 1870 to Knostrop Old Hall. Grid Reference: SE 32125 32100. He became successful in the 1870s and rented a second home, Castle-by-the-Sea in Scarborough. Scarborough became a favourite subject.

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999).

He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999). Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, which Caravaggio and Vermeer may also have used, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\".

Grimshaw painted more interior scenes, especially in the 1870s, when he worked under the influence of James Tissot and the Aesthetic Movement. \"On Hampstead Hill\" is considered one of Grimshaw's finest works, exemplifying his skill with a variety of light sources, in capturing the mood of the passing of twilight into night. In his later career his urban scenes under twilight or yellow streetlighting were popular with his middle-class patrons. His later work included imagined scenes from the Greek and Roman empires, and he painted literary subjects from Longfellow and Tennyson \u2014 pictures including \"Elaine\" and \"The Lady of Shalott\". Grimshaw named his children after characters in Tennyson's poems. In the 1880s, Grimshaw maintained a London studio in Chelsea, not far from the studio of James Abbott McNeill Whistler. After visiting Grimshaw, Whistler remarked that \"I considered myself the inventor of Nocturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" Unlike Whistler's Impressionistic night scenes, Grimshaw worked in a realistic vein: \"sharply focused, almost photographic\", his pictures innovated in applying the tradition of rural moonlight images to the Victorian city\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: , recording \"the rain and mist, the puddles and smoky fog of late Victorian industrial England with great poetry.\" Grimshaw's paintings depicted the contemporary world but eschewed the dirty and depressing aspects of industrial towns. \"Shipping on the Clyde\", a depiction of Glasgow's Victorian docks, is a lyrically beautiful evocation of the industrial era. Grimshaw transcribed the fog and mist so accurately as to capture the chill in the damp air, and the moisture penetrating the heavy clothes of the few figures awake in the misty early morning.Reputation and legacy. Grimshaw left behind no letters, journals, or papers. His reputation rested on, and his legacy is based on, his townscapes. There was a revival of interest in Grimshaw's work in the second half of the 20th century, with several important exhibitions devoted to it. A retrospective exhibition \"Atkinson Grimshaw \u2013 Painter of Moonlight\" ran from 16 April \u2013 4 September 2011 at Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate and subsequently in the Guildhall Art Gallery, London.Further reading. - Alexander Robertson, \"Atkinson Grimshaw\", London, Phaidon Press, 1996 - Yorkshire Art Journal \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", York, 2014 - Historical Feature\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: John Atkinson Grimshaw John Atkinson Grimshaw (6 September 1836 \u2013 13 October 1893) was an English Victorian-era artist best known for his nocturnal scenes of urban landscapes. He was called a \"remarkable and imaginative painter\" by the critic and historian Christopher Wood in \"Victorian Painting\" (1999). Grimshaw's love for realism stemmed from a passion for photography, which would eventually lend itself to the creative process. Though entirely self-taught, he is known to have used a camera obscura or lenses to project scenes onto canvas, which made up for his shortcomings as a draughtsman and his imperfect knowledge of perspective. This technique, which Caravaggio and Vermeer may also have used, was condemned by a number of his contemporaries who believed it demonstrated less skill than painting by eye, with some claiming that his paintings appeared to \"show no marks of handling or brushwork\", while others \"were doubtful whether they could be accepted as paintings at all\". However, many recognised his mastery of colour, lighting and shadow, as well as his unique ability to provoke strong emotional responses in the viewer. James McNeill Whistler, who Grimshaw worked with in his Chelsea studios, stated, \"I considered myself the inventor of no\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: cturnes until I saw Grimmy's moonlit pictures.\" His early paintings were signed \"JAG\", \"J. A. Grimshaw\", or \"John Atkinson Grimshaw\", though he finally settled on \"Atkinson Grimshaw\".Life. He was born on 6 September 1836 in a back-to-back house in Park Street, Leeds to Mary and David Grimshaw. In 1856 he married his cousin Frances Hubbard (1835\u20131917). In 1861, at the age of 24, to the dismay of his parents, he left his job as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway to become a painter. He first exhibited in 1862, mostly paintings of birds, fruit, and blossom, under the patronage of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. He and his wife moved in 1866 to a semi-detached villa, which is now numbered 56 Cliff Road in Headingley and has a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque, and in 1870 to Knostrop Old Hall. Grid Reference: SE 32125 32100. He became successful in the 1870s and rented a second home, Castle-by-the-Sea in Scarborough. Scarborough became a favourite subject. He died on 13 October 1893 of tuberculosis and is buried in Wood\n\nTitle: John Atkinson Grimshaw\nText: house Cemetery, now called St George's Fields, in Leeds. Four of his children, Arthur E. Grimshaw (1864\u20131913), Louis H. Grimshaw (1870\u20131944), Wilfred Grimshaw (1871\u20131937), and Elaine Grimshaw (1877\u20131970) also became painters.Work.

After graduation, he toured extensively and gave many recitals, where he was often accompanied by his brother J\u00f3zef on piano.

When his engagement to Isabella Hampton was opposed by her parents, Wieniawski wrote \"L\u00e9gende\", Op.\u00a017; this work helped her parents change their mind, and the couple married in 1860. At the invitation of Anton Rubinstein, Wieniawski moved to St. Petersburg, where he lived from 1860 to 1872, taught many violin students and led the Russian Musical Society's orchestra and string quartet.

Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. Historian Wolfgang Sauer says that \"although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler.\" In 2008, the German news magazine described Himmler as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history and the architect of the Holocaust. Historian John Toland relates a story by G\u00fcnter Syrup, a subordinate of Heydrich.

In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the Iron Cross and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut. After the war, Himmler completed his grammar-school education. From 1919 to 1922, he studied agriculture at the Munich (now Technical University Munich)  following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.

Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house.

Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main architect of the Holocaust. As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service, and did not fight. He studied agriculture at university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed by Adolf Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police).

His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (1865\u20131936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 1866\u20131941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (1898\u20131982) and Ernst Hermann (1905\u20131945). Himmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger.

Himmler was antisemitic by the time he went to university, but not exceptionally so; students at his school would avoid their Jewish classmates. He remained a devout Catholic while a student and spent most of his leisure time with members of his fencing fraternity, the \"League of Apollo\", the president of which was Jewish. Himmler maintained a polite demeanor with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism. During his second year at university, Himmler redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met Ernst R\u00f6hm, an early member of the Nazi Party and co-founder of the (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA). Himmler admired R\u00f6hm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion Himmler joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the (Imperial War Flag Society). In 1922, Himmler became more interested in the \"Jewish question\", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates.

The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the Nazi Party, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy, with the rank of. Around this time, Himmler joined the Artaman League, a youth group.

Hyperinflation was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons.

As a member of R\u00f6hm's paramilitary unit, Himmler was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch\u2014an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the Nazi Party to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence.

Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and a main architect of the Holocaust. As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service, and did not fight. He studied agriculture at university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed by Adolf Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). He controlled the Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS. Himmler held an interest in varieties of occultism and \"V\u00f6lkisch\" topics,\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText: . Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members. In 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the Nazi Party appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the Nazi Party, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the Nazi.\n\nInput: Heinrich Himmler joined the Nazi Party in 1923..\nIs the input True or False?

The performance of the eastern Waffen-SS units was, as a whole, sub-standard. In late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname \"the Butcher of Prague\". This appointment strengthened the collaboration between Himmler and Heydrich, and Himmler was proud to have SS control over a state. Despite having direct access to Hitler, Heydrich's loyalty to Himmler remained firm. With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the \"Einsatzgruppen\" in the lead-up to the planned invasion of the Soviet Union.

This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD. Hitler decided on 21 June that R\u00f6hm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated.

Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.

Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA. Himmler and Hitler met for the last time on 20 April 1945\u2014Hitler's birthday\u2014in Berlin, and Himmler swore unswerving loyalty to Hitler. At a military briefing on that day, Hitler stated that he would not leave Berlin, in spite of Soviet advances. Along with G\u00f6ring, Himmler quickly left the city after the briefing. On 21 April, Himmler met with Norbert Masur, a Swedish representative of the World Jewish Congress, to discuss the release of Jewish concentration camp inmates. As a result of these negotiations, about 20,000 people were released in the White Buses operation. Himmler falsely claimed in the meeting that the crematoria at camps had been built to deal with the bodies of prisoners who had died in a typhus epidemic. He also claimed very high survival rates for the camps at Auschwitz and Ber\n\nTitle: Heinrich Himmler\nText:  awkward in social situations. Himmler's diary, which he kept intermittently from the age of 10, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, dueling, and \"the serious discussion of religion and sex\". In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the Iron Cross and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut. After the war, Himmler completed his grammar-school education. From 1919 to 1922, he studied agriculture at the Munich (now Technical University Munich)  following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.

Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of (\"mission command\"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.See also. - Glossary of Nazi Germany - Heinrich Himmler papers - \"Lebensborn\" - List of Nazi Party leaders and officials - List of SS personnelReferences.References.:Bibliography.

Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich, and named Himmler Chief of German Police and a State Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. In this role, Himmler was still nominally subordinate to Frick. In practice, however, the police was now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force. He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Orpo: \"order police\"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege. Shortly thereafter, Himmler created the \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Kripo: criminal police) as the umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany. The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command.

The \"Einsatzgruppen\" (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II. Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of Himmler and Heydrich, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" units\u2014now repurposed as death squads\u2014followed the \"Heer\" (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians. Militias and \"Heer\" units also took part in these killings. Under Himmler's orders via the RSHA, these squads were also tasked with rounding up Jews and others for placement in ghettos and concentration camps.

On 21 June 1941, the day before invasion of the Soviet Union, Himmler commissioned the preparation of the \"Generalplan Ost\" (General Plan for the East); the plan was finalised in July 1942.

Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members. In 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the Nazi Party appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the Nazi Party, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature.

Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special \"Totenkopf\" insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\". Initially the camps housed political opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society\u2014criminals, vagrants, deviants\u2014were placed in the camps as well. In 1936 Himmler wrote in the pamphlet \"The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization\" that the SS were to fight against the \"Jewish-Bolshevik revolution of subhumans\".

In April 1921 the KPD leadership dispatched Arthur Ewert to the city of Halle to attempt to rebuild the party organization there following its destruction in the March Action. After only a couple weeks Ewert was arrested for his organizing activity, however, and he was transferred to the prison facility at Frankfurt, where he was held for two months with other communist activists without formal charges being filed. The state was unable to produce evidence that Ewert was involved in fomenting armed insurrection, however, and he was subsequently released.Biography.:Political rise. Ewert was elected to the governing National Committee (Zentrale) and its Politburo by the 8th Congress of the KPD in January 1923. Ewert was also elected as a KPD delegate to the 3rd Enlarged Plenum of Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) in 1923.

Ewert was voted off the Zentrale for factional reasons by the dominant party left wing at 9th Congress of the KPD, held in April 1924. Ewert and his co-thinkers Heinz Neumann and Gerhart Eisler were removed from the political scene for work in the Communist International in Moscow. Ewert was initially assigned to work in the Comintern's Balkan Commission, dealing with political affairs of the various Communist Parties of that region. Ewert was also put to work as a lecturer at the Comintern's International Lenin School, an institution established in 1925 for the intellectual and technical training of leading party cadres for life as \"professional revolutionaries.\" The fortunes of his \"center\" political faction soon improved in Germany, however, and Ewert was returned to his formerly held leading positions by the 10th Congress of the KPD in 1925 and re-elected by the 11th Congress in 1927.

At the 10th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, held in Moscow in 1929, Ewert came under fire from his factional opponents as a supporter of discredited Soviet leader Nikolai Bukharin, with KPD representative to ECCI Walter Ulbricht leading the attack of what he characterized as a \"Bukharin\u2013Humbert-Droz\u2013Ewert Group.\" This charge was echoed by Joseph Stalin's right-hand man, Vyacheslav Molotov, who singled out Ewert by name among those \"conciliators\" who lent de facto political support to the more moderate political line of Bukharin and his co-thinkers inside the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks).

The posting was not a desirable one, but was rather a form of banishment of the ideologically suspect Ewert from the decision-making centers of the Communist Party of Germany and the Comintern. Ewert worked closely with Comintern representative A. Guralsky to win popular expelled Brazilian political leader Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes to the Communist cause, regarded as a top priority task. The pair were successful in formally bringing Prestes over to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCB) by May 1931, with Prestes capping his conversion with a trip to Moscow that fall. It is unclear whether Ewert accompanied Prestes to the Soviet Union, but he did turn up again in Moscow in the spring of 1931, his Argentine mission at an end. In 1932 Ewert and his wife were dispatched as Comintern Representatives to the Communist Party of China, where they would stay until recalled to Moscow in 1934. From Moscow Ewert and Szabo were first sent to the United States, with Ewert using the pseudonym \"Harry Berger\" during his brief stay.

The posting was not a desirable one, but was rather a form of banishment of the ideologically suspect Ewert from the decision-making centers of the Communist Party of Germany and the Comintern. Ewert worked closely with Comintern representative A. Guralsky to win popular expelled Brazilian political leader Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes to the Communist cause, regarded as a top priority task.
