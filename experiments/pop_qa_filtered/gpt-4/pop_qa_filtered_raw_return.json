The brain of a smart person tends to be larger with more neural connections, enabling them to think critically, solve problems efficiently, and adapt quickly to new situations. Contrary to popular belief, smart people can also exhibit traits of introversion, anxiety, and overthinking.

Additionally, smart people are typically more adaptable and better at strategic planning due to their ability to visualize different scenarios and outcomes.

They are also found to be more open to new experiences and tend to be more curious, creative, and innovative. It's also interesting to note that smart people often have a high level of self-control, which helps them resist distractions and stay focused on their goals. However, being smart doesn't necessarily equate to being successful, as emotional intelligence and social skills play a substantial role in achieving success in life.",
        "Smart people, those with high intelligence quotient (IQ), have a unique set of characteristics and behaviors. Research suggests that they tend to be more nocturnal, staying awake later than the average person. They also tend to worry more due to their ability to envision a wide range of potential scenarios. Studies have shown that smart people are more likely to consume alcohol and use drugs due to their increased curiosity and desire for new experiences. They also demonstrate a high level of adaptability, which is a key factor in their ability to learn quickly and solve problems. Interestingly, there is also evidence that smart people often underestimate their intelligence, a phenomenon known as the Dunning-Kruger effect."
